  The Alamo Tech Collective is more than a hackerspace‚Äîit's a movement to build San Antonio's tech community from the ground up. Our mission goes beyond providing desks and WiFi. We're creating the conditions for a thriving tech ecosystem where knowledge is shared, connections are real, and talent chooses to stay. The hackerspace is our tool; a stronger, more connected San Antonio tech scene is our goal. Because when developers support each other, everyone benefits.
