## Now Open!

The Alamo Tech Collective hackerspace is officially open! We've created a dedicated space for San Antonio's tech communityâ€”a place where software developers, cybersecurity professionals, indie hackers, and tech students can work, learn, and collaborate.

### Who It's For

If you've ever felt out of place at a traditional coworking space, this is for you. We're building a tech-exclusive environment where:

- Software developers can code without distractions
- Cybersecurity professionals can practice their craft
- Indie hackers can build their projects
- Tech students can learn from experienced professionals

### What We're Building

- **24/7 Access** - Work on your schedule, not ours
- **Private VLANs** - Secure, isolated networks for your projects
- **High-speed Internet** - Because waiting for downloads kills productivity
- **Whiteboards** - For when you need to think out loud
- **Lab Space** - Test, experiment, and break things safely
- **Cold Brew Coffee** - Fuel for late-night coding sessions
- **Breakout Zones** - Collaborate or find your flow in quiet spaces

### Membership

**$99/month** for 24/7 access, unlimited coffee, and a community that gets it.

Join us during our open house events:
- **Byte Night** - Technical talks and community gatherings
- **Coffee and Code** - Morning coding sessions with fresh coffee
