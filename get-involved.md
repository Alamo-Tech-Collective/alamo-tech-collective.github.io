## Join San Antonio's Tech Community

**Remember: The hackerspace is just our tool. Building a thriving tech community is our mission.**

The Alamo Tech Collective is now open! We've created a dedicated hackerspace for San Antonio's tech communityâ€”a place where software developers, cybersecurity professionals, indie hackers, and tech students can work, learn, and collaborate. But more importantly, it's where we're building the connections and culture that will define San Antonio tech for years to come.

### Visit the Space

Come see what we're building! Schedule a tour to check out the space and meet our community. We're open 24/7 for members, and we'd love to show you around during regular business hours.
