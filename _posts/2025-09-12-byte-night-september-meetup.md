Friday night's Byte Night brought together roughly 18 people for our regular meetup. Here's a summary of the main discussions and topics that came up.

## New Faces and Introductions

Several first-time attendees joined us, including:

- An admin for Coupa (cloud-based invoicing) at a medical school
- Someone doing IT for the military at Lackland
- A recent arrival who'd been working remotely from Tel Aviv, Brazil, the Bahamas, Key West, and other locations before settling in San Antonio

## Technical Discussions

### AI and Development Tools
A significant portion of the evening focused on AI agents and development workflows:

- Using Claude and Playwright together for automation
- Multi-agent systems (MAS) for complex development tasks
- The FAR filter approach for evaluating AI output (Factual, Actionable, Relevant)
- Concerns about security in AI-generated code
- Discussion about AI prompt engineering and "reverse prompting" techniques

### Game Development
Multiple conversations about game engines and development:

- Building simple game engines with OpenGL and Vulkan
- Discussion of procedural generation using Perlin noise
- A gravity-based mobile game called "Graviton" that one member had published
- Unity's pricing changes and their impact on indie developers
- The challenges of maintaining mobile games across Android updates

### Other Technical Topics
- Distributed tracing challenges and solutions
- Custom mechanical keyboards, including one with only 30 keys using layers
- NoSQL vs SQL database choices
- An idea for an operating system without folders (using tags instead)
- QA automation terminology and best practices
- Testing strategies (TDD vs implementation-first approaches)

## Career and Business Discussions

- Job searching in San Antonio's tech market
- The prevalence of government and banking jobs requiring security clearances
- Comparisons between San Antonio and Austin tech scenes
- The challenges of running a software agency

## Community Updates

- Taco Tuesday Open Source Builder Night continues every other Tuesday
- Coffee & Code this Sunday (7-11am) had 14 RSVPs, up from the usual 6
- Plans for an AI-assisted coding workshop later in the month
- Discussion about using AI agents to guide development rather than writing all code directly

## Notable Quotes and Moments

- "I've been to meetups in Austin and this is so much more chill"
- Someone describing the scene as potential "fight club with keyboards"
- One attendee mentioned they've been to other meetups in San Antonio and this is the only one where real technical conversations happen
- Discussion about the eternal struggle of naming variables
- A member's approach to incremental development: "finish a piece, build it, see if it works, and then push it out"
- As one attendee noted while leaving: "A lot of smart minds in the building"
